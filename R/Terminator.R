#' @description
#' Abstract `Terminator` class that implements the main functionality each terminator must have.
#' A terminator is an object that determines when to stop the tuning.
#'
#' Termination of tuning works as follows:
#' * Evaluations in a tuner are performed in batches.
#' * Before and after a batch evaluation the [Terminator] is checked, if it is positive, we stop.
#' * The tuning algorithm itself might decide not to produce any more points, or even might decide to do a smaller batch in its last evaluation.
#'
#' Therefore the following note seems in order:
#' While it is definitely possible to execute a fine-grained control for termination, and for many tuners we can specify exactly when to stop,
#' it might happen that a few too many or even a few too few evaluations are performed, especially if the batch size is larger than 1.
#' So better check the size of the returned archive.
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' t = Terminator$new(param_set = ParamSet$new())
#' ```
#' * `param_set` :: [paradox::ParamSet]\cr
#'   Set of control parameters for terminator.
#'
#' @section Fields:
#'
#' * `param_set` :: [paradox::ParamSet]\cr
#'
#' @section Methods:
#' * `is_terminated(inst)`\cr
#'   [TuningInstance] -> `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Is `TRUE` iff the termination criterion is positive.
#'   Must be implemented in a subclass.

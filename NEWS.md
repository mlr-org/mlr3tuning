# mlr3tuning 0.2.0.9000

* `Archive` is `ArchiveTuning` now which stores the benchmark result in
`$benchmark_result`. This change removed the resample results from the archive
but they can be still accessed via the benchmark result.

# mlr3tuning 0.2.0

* `TuningInstance` is now `TuningInstanceSingleCrit`. `TuningInstanceMultiCrit`
is still available for multi-criteria tuning.
* Terminators are now accessible by `trm()` and `trms()` instead of `term()` and
`terms()`.
* Storing of resample results is optional now by using the
`store_resample_result` flag in `TuningInstanceSingleCrit` and
`TuningInstanceMultiCrit`
* `TunerNLoptr` adds non-linear optimization from the nloptr package.
* Logging is controlled by the `bbotk` logger now.
* Proposed points and performance values can be checked for validity by
activating the `check_values` flag in `TuningInstanceSingleCrit` and
`TuningInstanceMultiCrit`.

# mlr3tuning 0.1.3

* mlr3tuning now depends on the `bbotk` package for basic tuning objects.
  `Terminator` classes now live in `bbotk`. As a consequence `ObjectiveTuning`
  inherits from `bbotk::Objective`, `TuningInstance` from `bbotk::OptimInstance`
  and `Tuner` from `bbotk::Optimizer`
* `TuningInstance$param_set` becomes `TuningInstance$search_space` to avoid
  confusion as the `param_set` usually contains the parameters that change the
  behaviour of an object.
* Tuning is triggered by `$optimize()` instead of `$tune()`

# mlr3tuning 0.1.2

* Fixed a bug in `AutoTuner` where a `$clone()` was missing. Tuning results are
  unaffected, only stored models contained wrong hyperparameter values (#223).
* Improved output log (#218).

# mlr3tuning 0.1.1

* Maintenance release.

# mlr3tuning 0.1.0

* Initial prototype.
